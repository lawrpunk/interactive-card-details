I created an **Interactive Card Details Form** as part of the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-card-details-form-XpS8cKZDWw) challenge. This project provides users with a stylish layout for entering card details. It includes a range of interactive elements, such as real-time card detail updates as the user types. The form also includes validation to ensure data is entered correctly.
